#intro 
A Java application that solves the classic N-Queens problem with an interactive graphical user interface.
This project demonstrates algorithmic problem-solving techniques combined with modern GUI design using Java Swing.

The N-Queens problem is a classic chess puzzle where the challenge is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens can attack each other.
This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.


# Features
Interactive GUI: Clean and intuitive Swing-based interface
Visual Board Representation: Real-time visualization of the chessboard and queen placements
Customizable Board Size: Solve for different values of N
Solution Animation: Step-by-step visualization of the solving process

# Technologies

Java, Java Swing, Java AWT, Java ImageIO, Backtracking, Search algorithms, Concurrency(Runnable interface for threading)
